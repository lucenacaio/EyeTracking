C# samples for The Eye Tribe Tracker
====

This is the C# samples repository for The Eye Tribe Tracker. The implementation provides examples of how to use eye gaze coordinates for simple UI interaction. Furthermore, it contains basic UI elements useful to give feedback to the user and run a calibration.


Documentation
----

The EyeTribe API reference is found at [Eye Tribe Developer Website](http://dev.theeyetribe.com/api/).


Calibration
----

The calibration sample can be used to perform a user-based calibration on the system.


Scroll
----

The Scroll sample is a demonstration of how to employ natural scroll interaction while reading information-dense content (e.g., websites). Changing the information content is done with the mouse. A mouse-button down invokes a gaze-sensitive menu with selectable items and a mouse-up signals a selection to the application.
